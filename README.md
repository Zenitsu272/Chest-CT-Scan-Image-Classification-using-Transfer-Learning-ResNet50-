# Chest-CT-Scan-Image-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-ResNet50-
Using ResNet50 transfer learning, this project classifies Chest CT-Scan images into four categories: Adenocarcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Normal. The model is trained and fine-tuned on a public Kaggle dataset, enabling accurate lung cancer detection with minimal data and computational resources.
